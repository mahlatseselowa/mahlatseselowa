Question 1
1) Provide examples of the following types of meetings that take place in your organisation.  Indicate the title of the meeting and the topics discussed in the meeting. 



a) Status update meetings

b) Information sharing meetings

c) Decision-making meetings

d) Problem-solving meetings

e) Innovation meetings

f) Team building meetings




2) In your company, give practical examples of the following four leadership styles, with motivation as to why you believe them to be so. 



a) Autocratic


Autocratic leaders insist on doing it all themselves.

They have all the power, make all the decisions, and don't often tell anyone else about what they're doing. If you work for an autocratic leader, your job is usually to do what you're told

An autocratic leader often maintains his authority by force, intimidation, threats, reward, and punishment, or position. Although he may or may not have a clear vision, and may or may not be steering the organisation in the right direction, he's not concerned with whether anyone else agrees with what he's doing or not.

Autocratic leadership allows quick decision making and eliminates arguments over how and why things get done. At the same time, however, it may reduce the likelihood of getting a range of different ideas from different people, and can treat people badly, or as if they don't matter.


b) Managerial


The leader who sees him/herself as a manager is concerned primarily with the running of the organisation. Where the organisation is going is not at issue, as long as it gets there in good shape. 

A managerial leader may pay attention to relationships with and among staff members, but only in the service of keeping things running smoothly. Depending upon the nature and stability of the organisation.

His or her main focus may be on funding, on strengthening the organisation's systems and infrastructure (policies, positions, equipment, etc.), or on making sure day to day operations go well (including making sure that everyone is doing what he or she is supposed to be doing).


c) Democratic


A democratic leader understands that there is no organisation without its people.

Looks at his or her and others' positions in terms of responsibilities rather than status and often consults in decision making. While such a leader solicits, values, and takes into account others' opinions.

 He or she sees the ultimate responsibility for decision making as their own.

 They accept that authority also means the buck stops with them. Although they see the organisation as a cooperative venture, they know that they ultimately have to face the consequences of their decisions alone

Democratic leadership invites the participation of staff members and others, not only in decision making but in shaping the organisation's vision.


d) Collaborative


A collaborative leader tries to involve everyone in the organisation in leadership. 

They are first among equals, meaning that they initiate discussion, pinpoint problems or issues that need to be addressed, and keep track of the organisation as a whole, rather than focussing on one particular job. But decisions are made through a collaborative process of discussion, and some form of either majority or consensus agreement. Toward that end, a collaborative leader tries to foster trust and teamwork among the staff as a whole.

A collaborative leader has to let go of the need for control, power, or status if he or she wants to be effective. 

Their goal is to foster a collaborative process and to empower the group. It may be to empower staff and others involved in the organisation or to empower the community with which the organisation is involved.


3) Which decision-making processes does your company use in meetings? This does not need to be limited to one type.  


Considering the constraints given in a meeting, such as available time, decision making models may be applied to reach resolutions on various matters. Generally, technical review meetings would lean on the available expertise, data, market info, forecasts, and research, to reach certain conclusions in a meeting. 

 

Other models for decision making are: 

● Decision trees

● Critical path analysis

These are rational decision making models that use analysis and consider the advantages and disadvantages of various options.  

Voting

An easy way to generate a group decision in your meetings is to have participants vote. This can mean having meeting members raise hands and take the majority opinion or having them score available options. Both are effective strategies but run the risk of generating conformity among participants if they know what the rest of the group would like them to pick. 

Ranking

A majority vote is an efficient group decision method but it is not as revealing as other methods of group decision making. To understand more about where your meeting participants' opinions lie, you can modify a vote to include how the options rank against each other. 

These types of results give greater insight into where and to what degree the group preferences converge, rather than simply where they divide. Unfortunately, to collect and interpret the information using this group decision making technique can be difficult within the time constraints of a short meeting. It is possible to avoid this by asking group members to rank the options available before the meeting or to send out the results of a ranking after the meeting. 

Consensus

A consensus is a decision making approach that seeks to secure the support of the whole group for the decision at hand. Many people believe that consensus is the same thing as unanimous agreement, but this is not necessarily the case. Unanimity is when everyone agrees. The consensus is when no one disagrees.

A specific definition of consensus may be spelt out in a team's ground rules or operating agreements. When the definition isn't clear in advance, facilitators recommend clarifying what consensus means during the meeting. The recommended definition is "Everyone can live with and will support this decision." This allows everyone to acknowledge that while the decision they're making may not be perfect, it is acceptable and the team can move on.

Criteria-based rating

Criteria based rating is a technique designed to prioritise a group of potential alternatives under consideration. This is accomplished by identifying and weighing agreed upon criteria against each of those alternatives. Establishing criteria forces a group to articulate and examine their values, rationales, and assumptions before making their decision.

Criteria are standards from which one makes judgments or decisions, and their identity becomes the basis for evaluation.

It is much easier to reach consensus when deciding if the criteria are identified and agreed upon beforehand. People are much more willing to give up their favourite choices when they see that these favourites don't meet the necessary criteria. If there is no agreement on the criteria upfront, it is less likely that there will be agreement on the best alternative when it comes time to make the decision.

It is important to recognise that not all criteria are of equal importance and they should therefore have different weightings during the decision making process.

Paired comparison method

Paired Comparison Method is a handy tool for decision making; it describes values and compares them to each other. It's often difficult to choose the best option when you have different ones that are far apart. All the potential options are compared visually, leading to an overview that immediately shows the right decision. 

This makes it possible to compare the relative importance of opposing criteria in a simple way. If there is no objective data available for making the decision, the Paired Comparison Method can be a very handy tool.

- The chairperson should allow fair and open discussion of matters and stick to the agenda, so that decisions can be made. If there is no committee, the owners corporation chairperson must be a lot owner.





2) Review the person chairing your meeting and outline what makes a good chairperson? 

A good chairman is a good communicator. They need to be able to articulate their vision and goals clearly, and they need to be able to listen to others' ideas and feedback. They should be open to hearing other people's opinions and be willing to make changes based on what they hear.



Attributes of a great Chair.


Integrity.
Ability to influence others, without dominating. 
Personal strength. 
Clear vision and passion for the work. 
Emotional intelligence. 
Intellect and experience. 
Decisiveness. 
Ability to chair meetings.

3) If there is a conflict between participants in a meeting, explain how your chairperson resolves these conflicts and its effectiveness.


Conflict management is defined as the ability to identify and handle conflicts efficiently and fairly.  Leaders must deal with conflict management on a daily basis. It is important for leaders to remember to deal with the situation and be tempted to become involved in nonrelated issues. Leaders must ensure they continuously communicate with their team as well as articulate a vision. The impact of conflict in the workplace can result in a disruption of the effectiveness of employees and slow the achievement of organizational goals. Leaders are often challenged with navigating seamlessly through conflict. Identification of the conflicting source using a thorough assessment of the situation is essential.

Some important leadership strategies for dealing with conflict management include the following:

Act Responsibly. A leader must act responsibly when handling conflict. If the leader is not responsible, respect for the leader may be affected.
Diagnose the conflict. Diagnosis of the conflict begins with a thorough assessment of the situation. It is important for leaders to remember not to avoid the issue. The leader must make attempts to minimize or neutralize the conflict. The leader must remember they are not in a popularity contest and not all decisions will be supported by everyone. Before acting, the leader must ensure there is proof of wrongdoing. It is important not to create unnecessary conflict and not to wait until the situation is beyond repair. If the leader waits too long to act, others will feel the leader is hesitant to make decisions.
Maintain boundaries. A leader must assist and support others in maintaining boundaries. Additionally, the leader must possess enough self-awareness to keep themselves from crossing lines. An ongoing awareness of boundaries will help assist in establishing standards to prevent further conflict.
Respect differences. As opposed to influencing, the leader must respect the unique skills of those. Far too often, a leader sides with those they trust the most and do not venture out to capture the diverse skills of their employees.  A leader must work to appreciate the gifts everyone brings to the workplace.
Identify a goal. Leadership includes doing things others do not like to do. This includes conflict resolution. The leader must be careful when addressing only one person’s point of view. The leader must gather information, develop their own self-awareness, and be ready for the unexpected. A goal for managing conflict should be identified and strategies specific to achieving the identified goal should be implemented. This strategic approach can assist the leader in staying on task and resolving the issue at hand.

4) How does the chair of your company in a meeting ensure that meeting topics are prioritised and that discussion times are allocated according to importance, urgency, complexity, and agenda? 



5) How are decisions recorded and what information is provided to ensure that they can be effectively actioned. 

Providing information for decision making should be like telling a story. You need to know, first, what you want to say; second, whom you are addressing; and third, how to match the message and audience.




Step 1: Formulate a Focused Question

Too often, people are asking generic questions like “How successful was my campaign?” While that may be a valid business question, it is not something that you can answer without asking more questions and getting more context. Compared to what? Over what time period? You must first define what is important to your decisions and strategy. Understanding what question(s) you really need to answer is critical before you begin.

Step 2: Search for the best available data

Once you have your question(s), you then need to acquire the evidence to help you answer them and ultimately act on it and make a decision. This evidence typically starts with raw data, and then may go through various stages of transformations, aggregations and similar and probably leads to a visualization or set of visualizations that can be used to support your decision.

One model, the DIKW pyramid, talks about how to go from data to information to knowledge and eventually wisdom. If you connect enough of the raw data together, you will find patterns and turn that data into knowledge and wisdom. Another model, called Knowledge crystallization, explains the desire is to get the most compact description possible for a set of data relative to some task, without removing information critical to its execution. Knowledge that is proven useful and objective is kept and the rest is removed. This process explains how a person will gather data to answer their question, then try to make sense of it by constructing a schema for it, and then package it up into some view, or visualization to help see the insights.

This process of constructing a representational framework of your data into a visualization is one method of augmented intelligence. The visualization is enhancing the user's cognitive abilities and human intelligence. Nowadays, this process needs to go beyond just visualizations to having applications help you find patterns in your data like potential correlations to investigate and provide you with starting points to analyze.

Step 3: Critically appraise the data

Where the process typically fails is organizations stop at the previous step. Data and visualizations are not the end point, but just the starting point in the decision making process. This step is similar to the 'orient' stage of the OODA Loop and the 'hypothesis testing' stage of the Scientific Method. Here you are tasked with appraising the data. Make sure that you really understand the data you have, and what data you may not have. One of the tenants of Data Literacy is to be able to argue with your data. This is where that step comes into practice.

Do I have all the data needed? This is not a simple yes and no, but you need to also make sure you are not working with any unconscious bias about your data. There are many types of bias that impact decision making. Here we will highlight confirmation bias and survivor bias. Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek out information that supports your beliefs/hypothesis and ignore information that contradicts them. This is one reason I like using the scientific method, as it forces you to test your hypothesis and try to disprove it rather than trying to prove it. Survivor bias is another type of cognitive bias which occurs when you are making a decision using only part of the data based off past successes, and not based off past failures. This could include only using data from projects that succeeded rather than all projects, as an example.

Step 4: Integrate the evidence with your professional expertise and apply

While you have used data as your evidence up till this step to build a strong case for your decision, it is important to not forget the human element of this. Experience is just as valuable as evidence. When people make decisions, they are typically constructing mental models of the reality of the situation, including their assumptions, beliefs, experiences, and biases. Many times this mental model is done subconsciously. Since these mental models include people’s perceptions, and not necessarily hard evidence, we need to work on making those models visible to the decision maker so that they are not making incorrect inferences from them

Take time during this process to really understand your mental model and try to contradict your thoughts to poke holes in it. Two people with different mental models can see the same situation very differently. To overcome this at the organization level, you should work to create a culture of continuous learning and knowledge sharing. You should drive collaboration through reflective conversations. You should promote innovation and focus not just inward but also externally at trends in the industry. Many times organizations are so focused inward, they fail to see the external trends that will have a huge impact on their decisions.

Step 5: Monitor the outcome

Once you make your decision, it is important to assess the outcomes and either adjust accordingly, or add this to your previous experiences which will aid you in your decision making in the future. This is at the heart of an organization that fosters continuous learning and innovation.

Question 4
1)        Draft minutes of the technical meeting to ensure that they are produced accurately and in line with the policy and format required by your organisation.
